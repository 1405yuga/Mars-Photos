# Mars-Photos
Mars Photo is the android app which displays the mars surface obtained from real-life photos from Mars captured by NASA's Mars rovers.  The solution app will demonstrate the use of Retrofit to make REST requests to the web service, Moshi to handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and Coil to load images by URL.
